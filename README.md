# KeyPuncher-DiscordBot

This is a personal project that I used for entertainment as well as a learning tool to better my knowledge of coding languages.
Within the repository you will find various pre-made modules labeled "node_modules" such utilized within the program, The main program is located within "index.js" and ran via node.

A few of the modules I created are located within the "commands" folder, and the "custom_modules" folder. Both of which contain various small commands created within the bot.
The main purposed of the bot creates a "currency" system within a discord server and allows users to track their stats.
